# Material & vintage → break likelihood (sources)

Saved: 2025-12-31

## Key points captured
- **CI & AC**: among the highest-break materials in large break-rate datasets; **older cohorts (50+ years)** show higher break rates.
- **AC**: multiple summaries note many AC networks are now **near/over 50 years**, with increasing failures as pipes approach end-of-life.
- **PVC**: consistently reported among the **lowest break-rate** materials in available studies; observed age effect appears weaker so far.
- **PCCP / concrete cylinder pipe**: multiple sources describe **problem vintages** tied to **Class IV prestressing wire**; industry writeups often flag **1972–1978** as the highest-distress window, with **~1970–1980** elevated relative to other eras.

## Sources (with your takeaways)

### 1) CI & AC — old pipe = higher break rates
- **Folkman (2018)** — *Water Main Break Rates in the USA and Canada*  
  CI and AC are reported among the highest break-rate materials; PVC is among the lowest. The report also notes a large share of CI (and a significant share of AC) is in older age cohorts (50+ years), with higher break rates in those cohorts.

- **Folkman (study update / summary PDF example, 2024 host)**  
  Summary/update of the same break-rate work: again highlights very old CI and AC cohorts and higher break rates in aged cohorts.

### 2) AC near/over 50 years — approaching end-of-life
- **Brabant Water / pilot project summary (Ontario Water Consortium page)**  
  Notes many AC assets are 50+ years old and describes rising failure risk as AC approaches end-of-life (example break-rate figure is cited on the page).

### 3) PVC — lowest break rate in cited datasets
- **Uni-Bell PVC pipe longevity report**  
  Summarizes dig-up / longevity observations and break-rate comparisons that report PVC among the lowest break-rate materials and supportive of long service life.

- **Uni-Bell-hosted copy of Folkman 2018 (PDF)**

### 4) PCCP / PCI — vintage effect (1972–1978 highest; ~1970–1980 elevated)
- **Ball (2012)** — *Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe Rehabilitation, Repair, and Replacement*  
  Describes elevated failures tied to manufacturing / materials issues in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, including Class IV prestressing wire.

- **Middlesex County Utility Authority — PCCP case study (PDF)**  
  Case study describing failures concentrated in certain manufacturing eras and associated with Class IV reinforcing wire (Interpace Corporation examples).

- **Xylem / AWWA vintage analysis blog**  
  Industry writeup stating PCCP manufactured from **1972 to 1978** has the highest distress rates per AWWA “vintage” framing, and attributing the window to thinner mortar coatings and Class IV wire permitted during the period.

- **GovMarketNews summary (secondary)**  
  Secondary summary discussing older cohorts and reported average failure ages; useful as a lay summary, not a primary technical source.
