1) How to add the roads dataset (GIS workflow)

You generally want a roads-layer with at least:

functional class (arterial / collector / local)

number of lanes or ROW width

ideally AADT (average annual daily traffic)

truck route flags (if available)

For Calgary, the best source is usually the City of Calgary Open Data “Roads / Transportation” layers — they contain road classification and in some areas AADT.

Once you have both layers:

Buffer water mains slightly (e.g., 1–2 m)

Intersect or spatial-join roads to mains

Assign the highest road class touching that pipe segment

That gives each pipe a categorical traffic exposure value.

You do not want distance-based nearest road mapping — mains directly under roads experience loading very differently than those in boulevard / greenbelt alignments.

2) Why roads affect failure risk

Traffic loading increases failure probability through:

repeated vibration cycles

dynamic vertical stress transfer

trench settlement / fatigue

heavy axle point loads over shallow mains

frost heave amplification in winter

Pipes most affected:

cast iron

asbestos cement

older PVC

PCCP with cracked mortar

any pipe with shallow cover

Less affected but still influenced:

DI / steel (unless corrosion-thinned)

3) Quantifying risk — three common approaches

Below are realistic, defensible approaches used by utilities.

Method A — Road class → categorical risk uplift (most common)

Map functional class to risk categories.

Example:

Road class	Typical meaning	Risk uplift (LoF)
Local / residential	light traffic	0
Collector	moderate traffic & buses	+0.5
Minor arterial	high traffic	+1.0
Major arterial / primary	heavy vehicles	+1.5
Expressway / freeway	extremely high vibration	+2.0

Notes:

uplift applies only to brittle or aged pipes

not applied to newer PVC / HDPE unless shallow

can be capped if other factors already high

This approach is transparent and auditable.
